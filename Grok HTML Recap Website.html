    <h1> What I have learned in coding using Grok </h1>

    <h2 class="subheading"> Colour and Background Colour </h2>

    <p class="paragraph">Color and background color were one of the first things that I learned when I was using Grok. To be honest, it was kind of easy once I remembered the semi-colons.</p>

    <h3 class="subheading"> Font Sizes and Families </h3>

    <p class="paragraph">I played around a lot with font-size and other ways to mess with text. There are a lot of different commands and it takes time to learn them all.</p>

    <h4 class="subheading"> Margins, Padding and Borders </h4>

    <p class="paragraph">I learnt about how to organise your content. The padding is on the very outside. The margin makes whitespace around the object and the border outlines it all.</p>
   
    <span class="paragraph"> This is an example of what you can do with margins, padding and borders.</span>

    <h5 class="subheading"> Importing and Playing Around With Images </h5>

    <p class="paragraph"> You can import images and then you can change the shape using the techniques that I mentioned before. (Margins, padding and borders).</p>
